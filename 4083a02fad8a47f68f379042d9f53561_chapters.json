The personality adjustment that you need to make in order to attract the type of women you want is to be the go getter ambitious mentality. If you're a coward, your approach weak, your cadence and your voice weak, and you're not slow and in control. This year, Xander created a new mentorship for beta males. He also released the Freedom Academy, an exact step by step schooling process. Xander has been documenting his exact journey, A to Z, for years now. Xander believes results matter in life, and people judge you based off of your successes and failures. There is a beta male mentality that a woman should love a man for who he is, not for what he is. This mentality is a problem for men who want to be successful in life and in relationships. They need a brotherhood and a network like the one provided for them in the Freedom Academy.",
